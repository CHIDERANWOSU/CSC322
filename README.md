Preparation
CSC322 has the pre-requisites:
CSC220 or EEN218
Students who do not meet the pre-requisites must tell the instructor.
Instructor
Dr Stefan Wuchty (Click link for contact details). Students are encouraged to ask questions by email at all times, drop by the office (when the door is open) or call (305-284-4189).
Teaching Assistant
Nelson Dellis
Contact Hours
Each week there are two 75 minute minute lectures:
Tuesday and Thursday, 12:30PM - 1:45PM, 112 Whitten LC 130.
The teaching assistant Nelson Dellis will have lab hours during which you can receive help with lab tasks and assignments:
Thursday, 10 - 12AM
Friday, 9 -11 AM
Students are required to read their email regularly, and to consult the subject WWW page regularly.

Resource materials
A computer is not required. However, a laptop in class is useful to follow and try out examples. Homework can be done on lab computers in the Dept. of Computer Science.
There is no required text.

A useful book about working in the UNIX environment is:

Sarwar S., Al-Saqabi K.(2003), LINUX Programming Tools: A Primer for Software Developers (1st edition), Addison-Wesley.
or

Sarwar S.M., Koretsky R., Sarwar S.A. (2005), Unix the textbook, Addison Wesley.
or

Glass G., Ables K. (2007), Linux for Programmers and Users, Prentice-Hall.
or

Schwartz D. (2006), Introduction to UNIX (2nd edition), Prentice-Hall.
A good book for learning C is:
King K.N., (2008), C Programming: A Modern Approach (2nd edition), Norton Books.
If you are already a C programmer and would like an excellent reference text, I like:
Harbison S.P., Steele G.L.(2002), C: A Reference Manual (5th edition), Prentice-Hall.
It will be useful to have a book on UNIX system programming:
Haviland K., Gray D., Salama B. (1998), UNIX System Programming (2nd edition), Addison Wesley.
or

Rochkind M. (2004), Advanced UNIX Programming (2nd edition), Addison-Wesley.
Course content, lab tasks (aka homework) are available on the WWW.
Assessment
60%	Laboratory tasks (aka 'homework')
20%	Midterm
20%	Final
To pass the class with a C- 65% are needed.

Assignments will be placed on the WWW (usually on Friday afternoon). The submission requirements for each assignment will be given with each assignment.

Late submissions will not be accepted! However, extensions may be granted. Application for an extension must be made to the instructor BEFORE the due date. Otherwise, extensions of the due date will be granted if supporting documentary evidence is supplied (e.g., a doctor's certificate).

Homework and projects need to be uploaded using submit2! Just having completed assignments in student accounts will not be considered as submitted homework!

Assessment items must be completed individually. While general interaction between students is encouraged, plagiarism is a breach of the Honor code. It is ok to talk to other students about general solution techniques for assignments, but it is not ok to copy solutions in part or as a whole. Plagiarism will result in a loss of marks for all guilty students involved.
